* **0. Import a simple function from a simple file** - Write a program that imports the function `def add(a, b):` from the file `add_0.py` and prints the result of the addition `1 + 2 = 3`. - `0-add.py`.
* **1. My first toolbox!** - Write a program that imports functions from the file `calculator_1.py`, does some Maths, and prints the result. - `1-calculation.py`.
* **2. How to make a script dynamic!** - Write a program that prints the number of and the list of its arguments. - `2-args.py`.
* **3. Infinite addition** - Write a program that prints the result of the addition of all arguments. - `3-infinite_add.py`.
* **4. Who are you?** - Write a program that prints all the names defined by the compiled module [hidden_4.pyc](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x02.py/raw/master/hidden_4.pyc) (please download it locally). - `4-hidden_discovery.py`.
* **5. Everything can be imported** - Write a program that imports the variable `a` from the file `variable_load_5.py` and prints its value. - `5-variable_load.py`.
* **6. Build my own calculator!** - Write a program that imports all functions from the file `calculator_1.py` and handles basic operations. - `100-my_calculator.py`.
* **7. Easy print** - Write a program that prints `#pythoniscool`, followed by a new line, in the standard output. - `101-easy_print.py`.
* **8. ByteCode -> Python #3** - Write the Python function `def magic_calculation(a, b):` that does exactly the same as the given Python bytecode. - `102-magic_calculation.py`.
* **9. Fast alphabet** - Write a program that prints the alphabet in uppercase, followed by a new line. - `103-fast_alphabet.py`.
